# Writing code
[Writing code](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/)
There is a discussion of sourcing around 17.30 to 19.00.  To comment out a whole section of code (control-shift C)

Alt-shift enter is a short-cut for source.

Shortcuts

* Alt - is `<-`
* Control Shift M is `%>%`
* Control Shift C is Comment out
* Control Shift / will reflow the comment
* `Fun` will create the basics of a function
* If there is some code that works well, the lines of code can be turning into a fucntion, use R-studio (code extract function) to turn it into a function. 
* Multiple cursors: Control Alt up or down

# Debugging code
[Debugging code](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-programming-part-2/)

Useful commands

* `debug()`
* `undebug()`
* `browser()`
* `traceback()`
* `options(error = browser)`
* `options(error = NULL)`
* `debugonce()`

Call `debugonce("name of function")`.  The next time the function is run, the dubugger function is run. Opens the debugger mode.  Stops the execution and highlights the code where stopped. You can look up variables or change variables. `next` will run one line at a time. `step into` will step into an auxilliary function to look at its effect on the main function. 

`browser()` command, with the function inside, will open the debugger whenever the fuction is run. This has to be removed from the code otherwise it will open the debugger each time it is run in the future. 

As an alternative to this, put a `break point` by clicking in the margin.  You will get a red dot. This acts just like a browser statement.  This is easy to turn off and on. 

For errors, R-studio may provide a `call traceback`. This will tell you which function caused the error. R-studio can also provide an option to `rerun with debug`. This will help you find the spot and fix the error. It may be something like a factor input instead of a string. 

These can also be used with R-markdown and Shiny. 

It is best to put a `browswer()` statement in the markdown.  The `break points` will not yet work. However, that may change. Markdown is operating as if there is another R session in the background (so that workspace variables are not run). Breakpoints can be run in Shiny. 

# Package writing
Now that the code works, find out how to put the code into a package. 

A package is just a collection of datasets and functions. It is just an agree file struture. Hadley Wickham has written a book, [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz)

It is important to put the files into the correct structure so that the system knows where to find the components. Start with `new project`.  Add the R files one at a time to the package.  The structure will be created. The codes will be in the R folder. 

The description file tells us what the package does. R-studio creates template. Packages that are required should be listed under imports. 

It is important to load the package so that you are sure that the current version is what you are testing. There are a number of keyboard shortcuts

* Load all `control shift L`
* Document `control shift D`
* Test `control shift T`
* Check `control shift E`
* Build and reload `control shift B`
* Roxygen skelaton `control alt shift R`

## Help pages
These go in `man`

This will go in a specific Rd file.  It is best to link the functions and the help pages.  The `Roxygen` package can be implemented from the options. Use the package. The Roxygen skelaton is placed infront of each function. This will be used to create the documentation. `@param` will describe the parameters. `@return` speaks of the return variables.  `@export' are the functions that you want to user to be able to use. 

This cna be creaed from the build commmand.

## Add data

The data is saved as a `.RData` file.  This can be documented in a R file. 

## Tests

It is also possible to load some tests to check that the functions work the way that they are supposed to work.  These tests can be used whenever there is a change. Need to think more about the tests. This is something that Mango are keen on. 

There is a `check` option that R-studio will run. This will include warnings and errors. There are also possible problems in Notes. These can be ignored. 

## Distribute package

This can be downloaded from Github. The package can be built as a tar. 

There is a package development cheat sheet. There is an overview of package vignettes in the R-markdown documentation. 

Packages need to be checked when there is a new version or R.  In most cases, it should work but occasionally it will break.
